# About Me

Hello, my name is Ashley Tucker and welcome to my github! I am a very passionate game developer who has created many games throughout my time at college and plan to continue creating games that inspire change throughout my future career.

I started programming in my last year of high school with Python, and I was instantly hooked. I decided to pursue it into college, and combine it with my passion for games that I have had all my life. Since attending college, I have become very adept in many different languages and created amazing and impactful games alongside my peers. I hope to keep pushing myself farther and farther to help push the envelope on what a game can be throughout my career.
