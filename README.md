# About Me

Hello, my name is Ryan Tucker and welcome to my github! I am a very passionate game developer who has created many games throughout my time at college and plan to continue creating games that inspire change throughout my future career.

I started programming in my last year of high school with Python, and I was instantly hooked. I decided to pursue it into college, and combine it with my passion for games that I have had all my life. Since attending college, I have become very adept in many different languages and created amazing and impactful games alongside my peers. I hope to keep pushing myself farther and farther to help push the envelope on what a game can be throughout my career. 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finishing my last year of college, and have 2 projects that I am working on that I hope to display on my github by the end of the summer!
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently brushing up on my unity skills, and trying to learn C++ in Unreal Engine! Blueprints and visual coding are nice, but they have limitations that are not present in normal code.
  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about indie game projects!
  
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I can be reached through my website https://tuckdev.wordpress.com/
  
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: My pronouns are they/them
  
- âš¡ Favorite games: I have a great passion for online games that can create interconennected communities. I grew up with online game such as Wizard101 , Star Wars: The Old Republic, and Club Penguin, and continue playing those types of games with Destiny 2, Overwatch 2, and Pirate101. I also love singleplayer experiences that can leave a lasting impact on me such as Hollow Knight, Dark Souls, and all of the Zelda games (Majora's Mask is my favorite).
